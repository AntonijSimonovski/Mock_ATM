# Mock_ATM
This system allows the user to login into their account and deposit, withdraw money and view their balance or create an account. The database is made of files that contain all the information for every user and are used to check the login credentials and check if the username is already taken. 
The changes in the files are made by copying all the information that stays the same, deleting the initial file and creating a new file by pasting the copied data and the new data.
